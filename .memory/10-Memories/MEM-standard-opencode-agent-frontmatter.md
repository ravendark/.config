# OpenCode agent frontmatter must NOT include the 'model:' field

OpenCode agent frontmatter must NOT include the 'model:' field. Per .opencode/docs/reference/standards/agent-frontmatter-standard.md, the model field causes 'Model not found' errors because OpenCode's parseModel() function splits model strings by '/', so bare aliases like 'opus' produce {providerID: 'opus', modelID: ''} which fails model resolution. OpenCode uses session model selection via the TUI model picker. When porting agents from .claude/ to .opencode/, the 'model: sonnet' / 'model: opus' / 'model: haiku' lines must be deleted. This applies to 24+ domain agents in present and founder extensions that still have the 'model: sonnet' line.
