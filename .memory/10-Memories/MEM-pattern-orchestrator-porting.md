# When porting the orchestrator system from .claude/ to .opencode/, the dependency

When porting the orchestrator system from .claude/ to .opencode/, the dependency-driven 4-phase approach (architecture docs first, then state machine skill, then command, then verification) works well for complex multi-file ports. Sub-phases for the state machine (single-task, multi-task, drift+escalation, integration) provide independent verification gates. The skill-orchestrate SKILL.md is 1129 lines and requires careful section-by-section porting to preserve algorithmic structure (Kahn's algorithm, drift thresholds, loop guard limits) while only changing paths and tool names.
