# OpenCode headless/CLI API for programmatic agent control

OpenCode has a comprehensive headless/CLI API: 'opencode serve' starts a persistent server with basic auth (OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD), 'opencode run --command' executes named commands programmatically, 'opencode attach' connects to remote servers, and 'opencode session list/delete' manages session lifecycle. The --format json flag enables machine-parseable output. This client-server architecture means OpenCode agents can be controlled from external services like Discord bots or webhooks without the Neovim TUI.
