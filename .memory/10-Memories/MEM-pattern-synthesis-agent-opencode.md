# OpenCode's synthesis-agent pattern differs from .claude/: (1) The .claude/ team-

OpenCode's synthesis-agent pattern differs from .claude/: (1) The .claude/ team-mode skills fork a dedicated synthesis-agent that reads teammate outputs in fresh context; the .opencode/ team-mode skills do synthesis INLINE in the lead, causing lead context to grow by 7-21k tokens per team run vs ~250 tokens with the synthesis-agent pattern. (2) The .opencode/ context/reference/team-wave-helpers.md describes synthesis as an inline lead procedure (lines 232-281), contradicting the .claude/ pattern. (3) Porting the synthesis-agent requires: strip 'model: sonnet' from frontmatter, update .claude/context/ -> .opencode/context/ path references, preserve allowed-tools: Read, Write restriction.
