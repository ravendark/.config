# OpenCode static structural smoke test pattern for agent files: when live Task to

OpenCode static structural smoke test pattern for agent files: when live Task tool dispatch is not available in the agent's context, validate the agent file statically with: (1) `head -5` to verify `---` frontmatter delimiters, (2) `awk` to extract and count frontmatter fields (must be exactly 2: name, description), (3) `grep -nE '^model:|^allowed-tools:'` to confirm none of the unsupported fields exist, (4) extract all `@.opencode/path.md` references and verify each resolves to a real file, (5) `grep -n '\.claude/'` to confirm no .claude/ path leakage, (6) heading-by-heading diff against source to confirm no semantic content dropped. This pattern works for any .opencode/agent/*/port task.
