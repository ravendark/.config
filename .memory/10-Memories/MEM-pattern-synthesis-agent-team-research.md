# When team skills (skill-team-research, skill-team-plan) need to synthesize outpu

When team skills (skill-team-research, skill-team-plan) need to synthesize outputs from multiple parallel teammates, dispatch a named synthesis-agent rather than having the lead read all files inline. The synthesis-agent runs in a fresh context, reads all teammate finding files as @-references, and returns a compact summary (~200 words) to the lead. This keeps lead context growth at ~900 tokens instead of 7-21k tokens. The synthesis-agent is at .claude/agents/synthesis-agent.md and has allowed-tools: Read, Write only.
