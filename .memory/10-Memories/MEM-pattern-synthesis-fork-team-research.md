# Synthesis fork pattern for team research: The lead should NOT read all teammate 

Synthesis fork pattern for team research: The lead should NOT read all teammate output files inline (anti-pattern accumulating 4-12k tokens). Instead, fork an anonymous agent with the teammate file paths as @-references. The synthesis agent reads files in its own fresh context, performs conflict detection and gap analysis, writes the unified report, and returns a ~200-word summary. Lead context grows by ~250 tokens instead of 7-21k tokens.
