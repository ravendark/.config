# The inline GATE OUT defensive check blocks in research.md and plan.md (~38 lines

The inline GATE OUT defensive check blocks in research.md and plan.md (~38 lines each) are redundant with command-gate-out.sh, which already performs state.json and TODO.md defensive correction. These inline blocks should be removed to reduce command file size without losing functionality.
