# The .claude/ agent system has TWO distinct orchestrator concepts: (1) skill-orch

The .claude/ agent system has TWO distinct orchestrator concepts: (1) skill-orchestrator is a thin routing skill (160 lines) for command dispatch by task_type, and (2) skill-orchestrate is a 1129-line autonomous lifecycle state machine driving /orchestrate. The .opencode/ system has only the routing skill (128 lines, smaller, lacks context-protection directives) and is missing the state machine skill, the /orchestrate command, and the orchestrate-state-machine.md architecture doc. The .opencode/agent/orchestrator.md file is mislabeled - it documents a 'Read-only chat agent' for question answering, not the orchestrator system.
