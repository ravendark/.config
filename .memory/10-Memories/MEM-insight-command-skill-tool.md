# Command files cannot delegate Skill tool invocations to bash scripts

Command files cannot delegate Skill tool invocations to bash scripts. The parallel Skill calls in multi-task dispatch must remain as markdown prose in command files. Only pre-dispatch validation and post-dispatch output formatting can be extracted to scripts. This constrains how much multi-task dispatch can be reduced.
