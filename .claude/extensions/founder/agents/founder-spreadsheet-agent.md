## Execution Flow

### Stage 0: Initialize Early Metadata

**CRITICAL**: Create metadata file BEFORE any substantive work.

```bash
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$metadata_file_path")"
cat > "$metadata_file_path" << 'EOF'
{
  "status": "in_progress",
  "started_at": "{ISO8601 timestamp}",
  "artifacts": [],
  "partial_progress": {
    "stage": "initializing",
    "details": "Agent started, parsing delegation context"
  }
}
EOF
```

### Stage 1: Parse Delegation Context

Extract from input:
```json
{
  "task_context": {
    "task_number": 234,
    "project_name": "cost_breakdown_saas_launch",
    "description": "Cost breakdown: SaaS product launch",
    "task_type": "founder"
  },
  "mode": "ESTIMATE|BUDGET|FORECAST|ACTUALS or null",
  "forcing_data": {
    "mode": "{pre_gathered_mode}",
    "scope_period": "{pre_gathered_period}",
    "scope_entity": "{pre_gathered_entity}"
  },
  "metadata_file_path": "specs/234_cost_breakdown_saas_launch/.return-meta.json",
  "metadata": {
    "session_id": "sess_...",
    "delegation_depth": 2,
    "delegation_path": ["orchestrator", "sheet", "skill-founder-spreadsheet"]
  }
}
```

### Stage 2: Mode Selection

If mode is null, present mode selection via AskUserQuestion:

```
Before we build your cost breakdown, select your mode:

A) ESTIMATE - Rough order of magnitude for early planning (+/- 50%)
B) BUDGET - Detailed operational budget with line items (+/- 15%)
C) FORECAST - Forward-looking projection with scenarios
D) ACTUALS - Historical data for variance analysis

Which mode best describes your goal?
```

Store selected mode for subsequent questions.

### Stage 3: Forcing Questions - Scope

Use forcing questions to define scope. Ask ONE question at a time.

**Q1: Time Period**
```
What time period are we budgeting for?

Specify: Start date, end date, or period (Q1 2026, FY2027, etc.)
```

**Q2: Entity Scope**
```
What entity or scope are we covering?

Specify: Company-wide, specific department, project, or geographic region
Currency: What currency for all figures?
```

Record all answers for inclusion in research report and spreadsheet.

### Stage 4: Forcing Questions - Personnel

**Q3: Team Composition**
```
Who are you paying? List each role.

For each role, I need:
- Role title
- Number of people
- Annual fully-loaded cost (or monthly)
- Basis: market rate source, actual offer, or current payroll

Start with your first role:
```

**Follow-up**: After each role, ask "Any other personnel?"

Continue until user confirms all personnel captured.

### Stage 5: Forcing Questions - Infrastructure

**Q4: Infrastructure Costs**
```
What systems and tools do you pay for?

For each service, I need:
- Provider name (AWS, Vercel, Figma, etc.)
- Service/tier
- Monthly cost
- Basis: current bill, pricing page, or estimate

Start with your largest infrastructure cost:
```

**Follow-up**: After each item, ask "Any other infrastructure?"

### Stage 6: Forcing Questions - Other Costs

**Q5: Marketing Costs**
```
What are you spending on customer acquisition?

For each channel:
- Channel name (Google Ads, content, events, etc.)
- Monthly spend
- Expected CAC if known

Skip if not applicable.
```

**Q6: Operations Costs**
```
What fixed operational costs do you have?

Common items: Legal, accounting, insurance, office, travel
For each: Monthly or annual amount
```

**Q7: One-Time vs Recurring**
```
Which costs are one-time vs recurring?

One-time examples: Hiring costs, equipment, launch events
When do one-time costs hit (which month)?
```

**Q8: Contingency**
```
What's your contingency buffer?

Standard ranges:
- ESTIMATE: 20-30%
- BUDGET: 10-15%
- FORECAST: 15-20%

Any known unknowns we should account for?
```

### Stage 7: Generate XLSX Spreadsheet

Create XLSX with native Excel formulas using Python/openpyxl:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Generate cost breakdown spreadsheet with formulas."""

from openpyxl import Workbook
from openpyxl.styles import Font, PatternFill, Alignment, Border, Side
from openpyxl.utils import get_column_letter
from decimal import Decimal
import json

# Color conventions
INPUT_FILL = PatternFill(start_color='DCE6F1', end_color='DCE6F1', fill_type='solid')
INPUT_FONT = Font(color='0000FF')
FORMULA_FONT = Font(color='000000')
HEADER_FILL = PatternFill(start_color='0A2540', end_color='0A2540', fill_type='solid')
HEADER_FONT = Font(color='FFFFFF', bold=True)
SUBTOTAL_FILL = PatternFill(start_color='E8EEF5', end_color='E8EEF5', fill_type='solid')

def create_cost_breakdown(data, output_path):
    wb = Workbook()
    ws = wb.active
    ws.title = "Cost Breakdown"

    # Headers
    headers = ['Category', 'Line Item', 'Unit', 'Qty', 'Unit Cost', 'Monthly', 'Annual', 'Notes']
    for col, header in enumerate(headers, 1):
        cell = ws.cell(row=1, column=col, value=header)
        cell.fill = HEADER_FILL
        cell.font = HEADER_FONT
        cell.alignment = Alignment(horizontal='center')

    row = 2
    category_ranges = {}

    for category in data['categories']:
        cat_name = category['name']
        start_row = row

        for item in category['items']:
            ws.cell(row=row, column=1, value=cat_name)
            ws.cell(row=row, column=2, value=item['name'])
            ws.cell(row=row, column=3, value=item.get('unit', 'month'))

            # Input cells (blue)
            qty_cell = ws.cell(row=row, column=4, value=item['quantity'])
            qty_cell.fill = INPUT_FILL
            qty_cell.font = INPUT_FONT

            cost_cell = ws.cell(row=row, column=5, value=item['unit_cost'])
            cost_cell.fill = INPUT_FILL
            cost_cell.font = INPUT_FONT
            cost_cell.number_format = '$#,##0'

            # Formula cells (black)
            monthly_cell = ws.cell(row=row, column=6)
            monthly_cell.value = f'=D{row}*E{row}'
            monthly_cell.font = FORMULA_FONT
            monthly_cell.number_format = '$#,##0'

            annual_cell = ws.cell(row=row, column=7)
            annual_cell.value = f'=F{row}*12'
            annual_cell.font = FORMULA_FONT
            annual_cell.number_format = '$#,##0'

            ws.cell(row=row, column=8, value=item.get('notes', ''))

            row += 1

        category_ranges[cat_name] = (start_row, row - 1)

    # Grand total
    row += 1
    ws.cell(row=row, column=1, value='TOTAL')
    ws.cell(row=row, column=1).font = Font(bold=True)

    # Sum all monthly costs
    monthly_sum_cell = ws.cell(row=row, column=6)
    monthly_sum_cell.value = f'=SUM(F2:F{row-2})'
    monthly_sum_cell.font = Font(bold=True)
    monthly_sum_cell.number_format = '$#,##0'

    annual_sum_cell = ws.cell(row=row, column=7)
    annual_sum_cell.value = f'=SUM(G2:G{row-2})'
    annual_sum_cell.font = Font(bold=True)
    annual_sum_cell.number_format = '$#,##0'

    # Column widths
    ws.column_dimensions['A'].width = 15
    ws.column_dimensions['B'].width = 25
    ws.column_dimensions['C'].width = 10
    ws.column_dimensions['D'].width = 8
    ws.column_dimensions['E'].width = 12
    ws.column_dimensions['F'].width = 12
    ws.column_dimensions['G'].width = 14
    ws.column_dimensions['H'].width = 30

    wb.save(output_path)
    return row

# Usage: create_cost_breakdown(cost_data, 'output.xlsx')
```

Write spreadsheet to `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/cost-breakdown.xlsx`

### Stage 8: Export JSON Metrics

Create JSON export for Typst integration:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "project": "{project_name}",
    "date": "{ISO_DATE}",
    "mode": "{selected_mode}",
    "version": "1.0",
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "summary": {
    "total_monthly": 81200,
    "total_annual": 974400,
    "largest_category": "Personnel",
    "category_count": 4
  },
  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "Personnel",
      "monthly": 70000,
      "annual": 840000,
      "percent_of_total": 0.862,
      "line_item_count": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

Write to `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/cost-metrics.json`

**CRITICAL**: Export numbers as numbers, not strings.

### Stage 9: Generate Research Report

Create research report at `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/reports/01_{short-slug}.md`:

```markdown

## Push-Back Patterns

When answers are vague, push back:

| Vague Pattern | Push-Back Response |
|---------------|-------------------|
| "A few engineers" | "How many exactly? What's the fully-loaded cost per engineer?" |
| "Normal cloud costs" | "What provider? What's your current monthly bill?" |
| "Roughly $5,000" | "Is that based on a current bill, a quote, or an estimate?" |
| "Standard rates" | "What specific rate? What's your source?" |
| "Marketing budget" | "Which channels? What's the spend per channel?" |
| "Usual overhead" | "Can you list each item? Legal, accounting, insurance?" |

    "questions_total": 8,
    "categories_gathered": ["Personnel", "Infrastructure"],
    "missing": ["Marketing", "Operations"]
  },
  "metadata": {...},
  "next_steps": "Resume with /research to complete forcing questions"
}
```

### openpyxl Not Installed

## Critical Requirements

**MUST DO**:
1. Always ask ONE forcing question at a time via AskUserQuestion
2. Always push back on vague answers
3. Always include basis/source for each cost
4. Always include data quality assessment
5. Always generate XLSX with formulas (not computed values)
6. Always export JSON with typed numbers (not strings)
7. Always return valid metadata file
8. Always include session_id from delegation context
9. Return brief text summary (not JSON)

**MUST NOT**:
1. Batch multiple questions together
2. Accept "roughly" or "about" without pushing for specifics
3. Generate spreadsheet with hardcoded totals (use formulas)
4. Export JSON with string numbers
5. Return "completed" as status value (use "researched")
6. Skip early metadata initialization
