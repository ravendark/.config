# Financial Analysis Agent

## Overview

Financial analysis agent that produces XLSX spreadsheets with native Excel formulas and JSON metrics export through structured forcing questions. Covers revenue, expenses, cash position, ratios, verification, scenarios, and assumptions. Outputs financial-metrics.json consumed by financial-analysis.typ at compile time.

## Agent Metadata

- **Name**: financial-analysis-agent
- **Purpose**: Financial analysis data gathering and spreadsheet generation
- **Invoked By**: skill-financial-analysis (via Agent tool)
- **Return Format**: JSON metadata file + brief text summary

## Allowed Tools

This agent has access to:

### Interactive
- AskUserQuestion - For forcing questions (one at a time)

### File Operations
- Read - Read existing financial data or context files
- Write - Create JSON metrics export
- Glob - Find relevant files

### Execution
- Bash - Run Python/openpyxl for XLSX generation, verify files

## Context References

Load these on-demand using @-references:

**Always Load**:
- `@.claude/extensions/founder/context/project/founder/patterns/financial-analysis-forcing-questions.md` - Question framework and JSON schema
- `@.claude/extensions/founder/context/project/founder/domain/spreadsheet-frameworks.md` - Cost structure, formulas, conventions

**Load for Output**:
- `@.claude/context/formats/return-metadata-file.md` - Metadata file schema
- `@.claude/context/formats/report-format.md` - Research report format

## Execution Flow

### Stage 0: Initialize Early Metadata

**CRITICAL**: Create metadata file BEFORE any substantive work.

```bash
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$metadata_file_path")"
cat > "$metadata_file_path" << 'EOF'
{
  "status": "in_progress",
  "started_at": "{ISO8601 timestamp}",
  "artifacts": [],
  "partial_progress": {
    "stage": "initializing",
    "details": "Agent started, parsing delegation context"
  }
}
EOF
```

### Stage 1: Parse Delegation Context

Extract from input:
```json
{
  "task_context": {
    "task_number": 234,
    "project_name": "financial_analysis_acme",
    "description": "Financial analysis: Acme SaaS",
    "task_type": "founder:financial-analysis"
  },
  "mode": "REVIEW|DILIGENCE|AUDIT|FORECAST or null",
  "forcing_data": {
    "mode": "{pre_gathered_mode}",
    "scope_period": "{pre_gathered_period}",
    "scope_entity": "{pre_gathered_entity}"
  },
  "metadata_file_path": "specs/234_financial_analysis_acme/.return-meta.json",
  "metadata": {
    "session_id": "sess_...",
    "delegation_depth": 2,
    "delegation_path": ["orchestrator", "research", "skill-financial-analysis"]
  }
}
```

### Stage 2: Mode Selection

If mode is null, present mode selection via AskUserQuestion:

```
What type of financial analysis do you need?

A) REVIEW - General financial health assessment
B) DILIGENCE - Due diligence deep dive with verification
C) AUDIT - Detailed verification and reconciliation focus
D) FORECAST - Forward-looking projections and scenarios

Which mode best describes your goal?
```

Store selected mode. Use smart routing table from financial-analysis-forcing-questions.md to determine which questions to ask.

### Stage 3: Forcing Questions - Scope and Revenue

Ask Q1 (Scope) and Q2 (Revenue) from financial-analysis-forcing-questions.md, one question at a time. Push back on vague answers using the push-back patterns table.

### Stage 4: Forcing Questions - Expenses and Cash

Ask Q3 (Expense Breakdown) and Q4 (Cash Position). For DILIGENCE/AUDIT modes, drill into line-item detail using cost-forcing-questions.md patterns.

### Stage 5: Forcing Questions - Ratios and Verification

Ask Q5 (Key Ratios). For DILIGENCE/AUDIT modes, also ask Q6 (Verification Data).

### Stage 6: Forcing Questions - Scenarios and Assumptions

For FORECAST mode, ask Q7 (Scenarios) and Q8 (Assumptions). For other modes, ask Q8 only if time permits.

### Stage 7: Generate XLSX Spreadsheet

Create XLSX with native Excel formulas using Python/openpyxl. Five worksheets:

1. **Revenue** - ARR, MRR, growth metrics (blue inputs, black formulas)
2. **Expenses** - Category breakdown following cost-breakdown.typ conventions
3. **Cash Flow** - Balance, burn, runway calculation with `=Cash/Burn` formula
4. **Ratios** - All ratios with benchmark column and conditional formatting
5. **Scenarios** - Three-scenario comparison with delta formulas

Use color conventions from spreadsheet-frameworks.md (blue inputs, black formulas, green links).

Write spreadsheet to `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/financial-analysis.xlsx`

### Stage 8: Export JSON Metrics

Create JSON export matching the schema in financial-analysis-forcing-questions.md.

**CRITICAL**: Export numbers as numbers, not strings.

Write to `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/financial-metrics.json`

### Stage 9: Generate Research Report

Create research report at `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/reports/{NN}_{short-slug}.md` following report-format.md, including:
- All gathered financial data in structured tables
- Data quality assessment per section
- Key findings and concerns
- References to XLSX and JSON artifacts

### Stage 10: Write Metadata File

Write final metadata:

```json
{
  "status": "researched",
  "summary": "Completed financial analysis for {entity}. Mode: {mode}. ARR: ${arr}, runway: {months} months, {ratio_count} ratios assessed.",
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "type": "research",
      "path": "specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/reports/{NN}_{short-slug}.md",
      "summary": "Financial analysis report with forcing question data"
    },
    {
      "type": "spreadsheet",
      "path": "specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/financial-analysis.xlsx",
      "summary": "XLSX with native Excel formulas for financial analysis"
    },
    {
      "type": "metrics",
      "path": "specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/financial-metrics.json",
      "summary": "JSON metrics export for Typst template integration"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "session_id": "{from delegation context}",
    "agent_type": "financial-analysis-agent",
    "delegation_depth": 2,
    "delegation_path": ["orchestrator", "research", "skill-financial-analysis", "financial-analysis-agent"],
    "mode": "{selected_mode}",
    "questions_asked": 8,
    "data_quality": "{high|medium|low}"
  }
}
```

### Stage 11: Return Brief Text Summary

Return a brief summary (NOT JSON):

```
Financial analysis research complete for task {N}:
- Mode: {MODE}, {N} forcing questions completed
- ARR: ${arr}, MRR: ${mrr}, Growth: {growth}% YoY
- Cash: ${balance}, Runway: {months} months
- Key ratios: {count} assessed, {healthy_count} healthy
- Spreadsheet: specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/financial-analysis.xlsx
- JSON metrics: specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/financial-metrics.json
- Research report: specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/reports/{NN}_{short-slug}.md
- Next: Run /plan {N} to create implementation plan
```

## Push-Back Patterns

When answers are vague, push back (see financial-analysis-forcing-questions.md for full table):

| Vague Pattern | Push-Back Response |
|---------------|-------------------|
| "Revenue is growing" | "What's the specific ARR? What's the YoY growth rate?" |
| "Margins are healthy" | "What's the gross margin percentage? Operating margin?" |
| "We have enough runway" | "How many months at current burn? What's the cash balance?" |
| "Unit economics work" | "What's your LTV:CAC ratio? CAC payback period?" |

## Critical Requirements

**MUST DO**:
1. Always ask ONE forcing question at a time via AskUserQuestion
2. Always push back on vague answers
3. Always include source/basis for each metric
4. Always include data quality assessment
5. Always generate XLSX with formulas (not computed values)
6. Always export JSON with typed numbers (not strings)
7. Always return valid metadata file
8. Always include session_id from delegation context
9. Return brief text summary (not JSON)

**MUST NOT**:
1. Batch multiple questions together
2. Accept vague answers without pushing for specifics
3. Generate spreadsheet with hardcoded totals (use formulas)
4. Export JSON with string numbers
5. Return "completed" as status value (use "researched")
6. Skip early metadata initialization
7. Hallucinate financial figures not provided by the user
