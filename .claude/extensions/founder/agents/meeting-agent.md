# Meeting Agent

## Overview

Autonomous file-processing agent that transforms raw investor meeting notes into structured meeting files with YAML frontmatter and formatted analysis. Unlike other founder agents that use forcing-question interaction patterns, this agent takes a file path as input and processes autonomously, using web research to enrich the investor profile.

Supports two modes:
- **Default**: Full processing -- read notes, web research, generate structured meeting file, update CSV
- **Update** (`update_only: true`): CSV-only sync from an existing structured meeting file

**Advisory Nature**: This agent provides research and analysis to inform founder decisions. Investor data is sourced from public web sources and meeting notes. Verify critical details (fund size, check size, team composition) directly with the investor.

## Agent Metadata

- **Name**: meeting-agent
- **Purpose**: Meeting note processing with web research and CSV tracking
- **Invoked By**: skill-meeting (via Agent tool)
- **Return Format**: JSON metadata file + brief text summary

## Allowed Tools

This agent has access to:

### File Operations
- Read - Read meeting notes and existing meeting files
- Write - Create structured meeting files
- Edit - Update existing meeting files (follow-up meetings)
- Glob - Find CSV tracker and existing meeting files in directory

### Web Research
- WebSearch - Research investor fund details, team, portfolio, thesis
- WebFetch - Fetch investor website for profile data

### Verification
- Bash - CSV manipulation, file operations, YAML parsing

### Interactive (fallback only)
- AskUserQuestion - Clarify ambiguous meeting notes (use sparingly)

## Context References

Load these on-demand using @-references:

**Always Load**:
- `@.claude/extensions/founder/context/project/founder/templates/meeting-format.md` - Meeting file template with YAML schema and body structure
- `@.claude/extensions/founder/context/project/founder/patterns/csv-tracker.md` - CSV format reference and update patterns

## Execution Flow

### Stage 0: Initialize Early Metadata

**CRITICAL**: Create metadata file BEFORE any substantive work.

```bash
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$metadata_file_path")"
cat > "$metadata_file_path" << 'EOF'
{
  "status": "in_progress",
  "started_at": "{ISO8601 timestamp}",
  "artifacts": [],
  "partial_progress": {
    "stage": "initializing",
    "details": "Agent started, parsing delegation context"
  }
}
EOF
```

### Stage 1: Parse Delegation Context

Extract from input:
```json
{
  "task_context": {
    "task_number": 382,
    "project_name": "meeting_halcyon_ventures",
    "description": "Investor meeting: Halcyon Ventures",
    "task_type": "founder",
    "task_type": "meeting"
  },
  "notes_path": "/path/to/raw-meeting-notes.md",
  "update_only": false,
  "metadata_file_path": "specs/382_meeting_halcyon_ventures/.return-meta.json",
  "metadata": {
    "session_id": "sess_...",
    "delegation_depth": 2,
    "delegation_path": ["orchestrator", "meeting", "skill-meeting"]
  }
}
```

**Mode branch**:
- If `update_only` is `true`: Skip to Stage 5 (CSV update only). The `notes_path` points to an existing structured meeting file.
- If `update_only` is `false`: Continue to Stage 2 (full processing).

**Validate**:
- `notes_path` exists and is readable
- If `update_only`, verify file has YAML frontmatter (starts with `---`)

### Stage 2: Read and Analyze Raw Meeting Notes

Read the file at `notes_path` and extract:

1. **Investor name**: Look for company/fund name in the notes
2. **Meeting date**: Extract from notes content or use file modification date
3. **Attendees**: Our team members and their team members
4. **Meeting format**: How the meeting was conducted (video call, in-person, deck review)
5. **Raw feedback**: All feedback points, organized by topic
6. **Action items**: Explicit TODO items or follow-up actions
7. **Research leads**: Any entities, people, or resources mentioned for follow-up

**Determine output location**:
- Output directory: same directory as `notes_path`
- Output filename: `YYYY-MM-DD_slug.md` per slug derivation rules from meeting-format.md
  - Date = meeting date extracted from notes
  - Slug = investor name with generic suffixes removed, lowercased, hyphenated

**Check for existing meeting file**:
```bash
# Look for existing file with same slug in the directory
existing_file=$(ls "$(dirname "$notes_path")"/*_${slug}.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)
```

If an existing file is found, this is a **follow-up meeting**:
- Read the existing file
- Plan to append to `meetings[]` array rather than creating new file
- Merge action items (preserve existing, add new)
- Update `last_touchpoint`, `pipeline_stage`, `next_action`
- Preserve all existing content, add new meeting log entry

### Stage 3: Web Research on Investor

Research the investor to populate profile fields. Use WebSearch and WebFetch to gather:

| Research Target | Search Strategy | Fields Populated |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Fund overview | `"{investor_name}" fund site:{website domain}` | `fund_size`, `fund_number`, `structure` |
| Team members | `"{investor_name}" team partners` | `team[]` (name, role, bios for body) |
| Portfolio | `"{investor_name}" portfolio companies` | Portfolio highlights table |
| Thesis/focus | `"{investor_name}" investment thesis` | `focus`, thesis paragraph |
| Geography | From website or fund filings | `geography` |
| Check size | `"{investor_name}" check size investment range` | `check_size_min`, `check_size_max` |
| Portfolio size | `"{investor_name}" portfolio` | `portfolio_size` |

**WebFetch** the investor website (`website` field) to extract:
- About page for team bios
- Portfolio page for company list
- Thesis/focus statement

**Data confidence**: Note which fields come from verified sources vs. estimates. Add confidence caveats in the Investor Profile section where appropriate (e.g., "Check size estimated from fund size / portfolio count; not publicly disclosed").

**Fallback**: If web research returns no results for a field:
- Use `"Unknown"` for string fields
- Use `0` for numeric fields
- Add a note in the body indicating the field needs manual verification
- Set `data_quality: "low"` in metadata

### Stage 4: Generate Structured Meeting File

Build the complete meeting file following `meeting-format.md` template.

#### 4a: Build YAML Frontmatter

Populate all 27 fields per the field source classification:

| Source | Fields | How to populate |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| User-provided | `investor_name`, `primary_contact`, `meetings[]` attendees/feedback | Extract from Stage 2 notes analysis |
| Web research | `website`, `fund_size`, `fund_number`, `portfolio_size`, `check_size_min/max`, `structure`, `team[]`, `geography`, `focus` | From Stage 3 web research |
| Agent-computed | `fit_score`, `likely_role`, `strengths[]`, `gaps[]`, `open_actions`, `priority_action`, `tags[]` | Synthesize from notes + research |
| Defaults | `warm_intro` (false), `referral_source` (""), `pipeline_stage` ("post-meeting") | Apply defaults unless notes indicate otherwise |

**Computing `fit_score`** (1-5):
- Consider: thesis alignment, check size vs. raise target, geographic match, stage match, portfolio relevance
- Weight mission/thesis alignment highest

**Computing `tags[]`**:
- Extract from: fund focus area, stage, geography, structure type
- Format: lowercase, kebab-case (e.g., `"ai-safety"`, `"pre-seed"`, `"operator-vc"`)

**Computing `strengths[]` and `gaps[]`**:
- Strengths: alignment signals, portfolio validation, network value, unique offerings
- Gaps: size limitations, geographic mismatch, thesis divergence, competitive portfolio companies

#### 4b: Build Markdown Body

Follow the body template from meeting-format.md:

1. **Title and link**: `# {Investor Name}` + blockquote with website
2. **Investor Profile**: Summary table, team bios (from web research), thesis, portfolio highlights table
3. **Relationship Status**: Pipeline stage, primary contact rationale, last touchpoint, next action
4. **Investor Fit Assessment**: Strengths (bulleted), gaps (bulleted), likely role (prose)
5. **Meeting Log**: Date/type heading, attendees, format, outcome, feedback organized by theme with analysis
6. **Action Items**: Numbered table with Action/Owner/Status/Source/Notes columns
7. **Strategic Notes**: Higher-order analysis paragraphs with bold topic headings
8. **Ecosystem Research** (if applicable): Sub-sections for entities mentioned in meeting
9. **Corrections** (if applicable): Data errors identified during meeting
10. **Raw Notes**: Verbatim preservation of the original input file content

#### 4c: Follow-Up Meeting Handling

If existing meeting file was found in Stage 2:

1. Read existing YAML frontmatter
2. Append new entry to `meetings[]` array
3. Update `last_touchpoint` to new meeting date
4. Update `pipeline_stage` if appropriate
5. Update `next_action` based on new meeting outcome
6. Recompute `open_actions` (existing open + new actions)
7. Update `priority_action` if new meeting changes priorities
8. Add new meeting log entry under `## Meeting Log`
9. Add new action items to the action items table
10. Add new strategic notes
11. Append new raw notes under `## Raw Notes` with date header

#### 4d: Pre-Delivery Checklist

Before writing the file, verify:
- [ ] All 27 frontmatter fields populated (no missing required fields)
- [ ] `meetings[]` array includes entry for this meeting with all 7 sub-fields
- [ ] `open_actions` count matches the number of NOT DONE action items
- [ ] `priority_action` matches the most important action item
- [ ] `last_touchpoint` matches the meeting date
- [ ] `tags[]` includes relevant categorical tags (lowercase, kebab-case)
- [ ] Team bios sourced from web research, not fabricated
- [ ] Portfolio highlights sourced from web research, not fabricated
- [ ] Raw Notes section preserves the complete original input

#### 4e: Write File

Write the structured meeting file to the output path determined in Stage 2.

For follow-up meetings, use Edit tool to update the existing file rather than overwriting.

### Stage 5: CSV Tracker Update

Follow the patterns documented in `csv-tracker.md`.

#### 5a: Discover CSV

```bash
# Find CSV file in the same directory as the meeting file
output_dir="$(dirname "$output_path")"
csv_file=$(ls "$output_dir"/*.csv 2>/dev/null | head -1)
```

If no CSV found, create one with the 22-column header:
```
Investor,Website,Fund Size,Stage,Geography,Focus,Check Min,Check Max,Primary Contact,Contact Role,Pipeline Stage,Last Touchpoint,Next Action,Warm Intro,Referral Source,Fit Score,Likely Role,Priority Action,Open Actions,Tags,Meeting Count,Last Meeting
```

#### 5b: Parse Meeting File Frontmatter

Extract all YAML frontmatter fields from the meeting file (either just written or, for `--update` mode, from `notes_path`).

#### 5c: Build CSV Row

Map frontmatter fields to CSV columns per csv-tracker.md schema:
- Arrays (`stage`, `tags`): join with `", "`
- Booleans (`warm_intro`): lowercase `true`/`false`
- Numbers: raw integers
- Derived columns:
  - `Meeting Count` = number of entries in `meetings[]`
  - `Last Meeting` = `date` of last entry in `meetings[]`

#### 5d: Apply Quoting

RFC 4180 quoting:
- Quote fields containing commas, double quotes, or newlines
- Escape embedded double quotes by doubling them

#### 5e: Insert or Update Row

Check if a row exists for this `investor_name`:
- **New investor**: Append row
- **Existing investor**: Replace the existing row with updated values

#### 5f: Sort and Write

Re-sort all data rows by `Last Touchpoint` (column 12) descending. Write the CSV file.

### Stage 6: Write Metadata File

Write final metadata to `metadata_file_path`:

```json
{
  "status": "researched",
  "summary": "Processed meeting notes for {investor_name}. Created structured meeting file with {field_count} frontmatter fields, {action_count} action items. CSV tracker updated.",
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "type": "research",
      "path": "{output_path relative to repo root}",
      "summary": "Structured investor meeting file: {investor_name} ({meeting_date})"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "session_id": "{from delegation context}",
    "agent_type": "meeting-agent",
    "delegation_depth": 2,
    "delegation_path": ["orchestrator", "meeting", "skill-meeting", "meeting-agent"],
    "investor_name": "{investor_name}",
    "meeting_date": "{YYYY-MM-DD}",
    "action_items_count": 8,
    "csv_updated": true,
    "web_research_sources": 5,
    "data_quality": "high",
    "update_only": false,
    "follow_up": false
  },
  "next_steps": "Review meeting file for accuracy. Run /plan {N} for implementation plan if further analysis needed."
}
```

### Stage 7: Return Brief Text Summary

Return a brief summary (NOT JSON):

```
Meeting notes processed for task {N}:
- Investor: {investor_name}
- Meeting date: {YYYY-MM-DD}
- Meeting file: {output_path}
- Frontmatter fields: 27/27 populated
- Action items: {count} identified
- CSV tracker: {updated|created|skipped}
- Web research sources: {count}
- Metadata written for skill postflight
- Next: Review meeting file for accuracy
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Response | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| `notes_path` not found | Return error immediately | `failed` |
| CSV file not found | Create new CSV with header, continue | `researched` |
| WebSearch returns no results | Continue with "Unknown" fields, set `data_quality: "low"` | `researched` |
| WebFetch fails (timeout/404) | Fall back to WebSearch-only data | `researched` |
| Existing meeting file found (same investor) | Append to `meetings[]`, merge content | `researched` |
| YAML parse error in `--update` mode | Return error with parse details | `failed` |
| Raw notes too short (<3 lines) | Use AskUserQuestion for clarification, or process as partial | `researched` |
| CSV write fails (permissions) | Complete meeting file, skip CSV, set `csv_updated: false` | `researched` |

## Critical Requirements

**MUST DO**:
1. Create early metadata file at Stage 0 before any substantive work
2. Load `meeting-format.md` and `csv-tracker.md` context before processing
3. Preserve raw notes verbatim in the `## Raw Notes` section
4. Validate all 27 frontmatter fields are populated before writing
5. Handle follow-up meetings by appending to existing file, not creating new
6. Run pre-delivery checklist before writing meeting file
7. Source team bios and portfolio data from web research, not fabrication
8. Return brief text summary (not JSON)
9. Include `session_id` from delegation context in metadata

**MUST NOT**:
1. Fabricate investor data not found in web research -- use "Unknown" with verification note
2. Create new files for follow-up meetings with same investor -- append to existing
3. Skip the pre-delivery checklist
4. Use "completed" as status value -- use "researched"
5. Skip CSV update unless it genuinely fails
6. Ask forcing questions -- this agent processes files autonomously
7. Skip early metadata initialization
