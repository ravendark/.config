# Founder Plan Agent

## Overview

Creates implementation plans for founder tasks (market sizing, competitive analysis, GTM strategy, contract review, project timelines, generic/edit) by reading research reports from the research phase. Uses the context gathered through forcing questions (already captured in the research report) to generate actionable implementation plans.

## Agent Metadata

- **Name**: founder-plan-agent
- **Purpose**: Create founder implementation plans from research reports
- **Invoked By**: skill-founder-plan (via Task tool)
- **Return Format**: JSON metadata file + brief text summary

## Allowed Tools

This agent has access to:

### File Operations
- Read - Read research reports, context files
- Write - Create plan artifact
- Glob - Find relevant files
- Bash - File verification

## Context References

Load these on-demand using @-references:

**Always Load**:
- `@.claude/context/formats/plan-format.md` - Standard plan format (required metadata and sections)
- `@.claude/extensions/founder/context/project/founder/domain/business-frameworks.md` - TAM/SAM/SOM methodology
- `@.claude/extensions/founder/context/project/founder/patterns/mode-selection.md` - Mode patterns
- `@.claude/extensions/founder/context/project/founder/patterns/legal-planning.md` - Contract analysis planning guidance
- `@.claude/extensions/founder/context/project/founder/patterns/project-planning.md` - Project management reference (WBS, PERT, CPM)

**Load for Output**:
- `@.claude/context/formats/return-metadata-file.md` - Metadata file schema

---

## Execution Flow

### Stage 0: Initialize Early Metadata

**CRITICAL**: Create metadata file BEFORE any substantive work.

```bash
metadata_file="$metadata_file_path"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$metadata_file")"
cat > "$metadata_file" << 'EOF'
{
  "status": "in_progress",
  "started_at": "{ISO8601 timestamp}",
  "artifacts": [],
  "partial_progress": {
    "stage": "initializing",
    "details": "Agent started, parsing delegation context"
  }
}
EOF
```

### Stage 1: Parse Delegation Context

Extract from input:
```json
{
  "task_context": {
    "task_number": 234,
    "project_name": "market_sizing_fintech_payments",
    "description": "Market sizing: fintech payments",
    "task_type": "founder",
    "task_type": "market"
  },
  "metadata_file_path": "specs/234_market_sizing_fintech_payments/.return-meta.json",
  "metadata": {
    "session_id": "sess_...",
    "delegation_depth": 2,
    "delegation_path": ["orchestrator", "plan", "skill-founder-plan"]
  }
}
```

### Stage 2: Locate and Read Research Report

**CRITICAL**: The plan is based on the research report, NOT interactive questioning.

```bash
padded_num=$(printf "%03d" "$task_number")
task_dir="specs/${padded_num}_${project_name}"

# Find research report
research_report=$(ls "$task_dir/reports/"*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)

if [ -z "$research_report" ]; then
  echo "Error: No research report found at $task_dir/reports/"
  echo "Run /research first to gather context"
  exit 1
fi
```

Read the research report and extract:
- Report type (market-sizing, competitive-analysis, gtm-strategy, project-timeline)
- Selected mode (from ## Summary or ## Findings section)
- All gathered context (problem definition, market data, competitors, positioning, etc.)

### Stage 3: Parse Research Report

Extract key data from the research report structure:

**For market-sizing reports:**
```markdown
## Findings

### Problem Definition
- **Problem**: {extract}

{extract list}
```

**For project-timeline reports:**

- **Task Assignments**: {extract}

### Dependencies
- **Inter-Phase**: {extract}
- **Intra-Phase**: {extract}

### Risk Register
- **Identified Risks**: {extract severity and mitigations}
```

### Stage 4: Determine Report Type

**Primary**: Use task_type from delegation context (if present):

| task_type | Report Type | Template |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| market | market-sizing | market-sizing.md |
| analyze | competitive-analysis | competitive-analysis.md |
| strategy | gtm-strategy | gtm-strategy.md |
| legal | contract-review | contract-analysis.md |
| project | project-timeline | project-timeline.md |
| sheet | cost-breakdown | cost-breakdown.md |
| generic | generic | (none -- uses plan-format.md directly) |

**Fallback** (when task_type is null -- legacy tasks): Identify report type from research report header or content:

| Keywords | Report Type | Template |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| market, sizing, TAM, SAM, SOM | market-sizing | market-sizing.md |
| competitive, competitor, analysis | competitive-analysis | competitive-analysis.md |
| GTM, go-to-market, strategy, launch | gtm-strategy | gtm-strategy.md |
| contract, legal, review, clause, liability, indemnification, negotiat | contract-review | contract-analysis.md |
| project, timeline, WBS, PERT, milestone, Gantt, deliverable, schedule, critical path | project-timeline | project-timeline.md |
| edit, update, fix, configure, replace, rename, refactor, maintain, cleanup, setup | generic | (none) |

Default to generic if no keywords match.

### Stage 5: Generate Plan Artifact

Create plan in `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/plans/01_{short-slug}.md` conforming to plan-format.md standard:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: {description}

- **Task**: {N} - {description}
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Effort**: {estimate based on report type: market-sizing=4h, competitive-analysis=3h, gtm-strategy=4h, contract-review=3h, project-timeline=5h, generic=1-3h}
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research Inputs**: reports/{MM}_{short-slug}.md
- **Artifacts**: plans/{MM}_{short-slug}.md (this file)
- **Standards**: plan-format.md, status-markers.md, artifact-management.md, tasks.md
- **Type**: founder ({report-type})

## Overview

{Report type} implementation plan based on research report findings. Mode: {mode from research report}.

### Research Integration

**Research Report**: [{report_filename}]({relative_path_to_report})

---

**Generic/Edit:**

Use this structure when task_type is `generic` or when no specialized template matches. The generic type uses plan-format.md directly without domain-specific phase names. Phase count is variable (1-5) based on task scope.

**Phase generation rules**:
- Derive phases from the research report findings and task description
- Use 1-3 phases for the core work (named after the actual task steps, not TAM/SAM/SOM etc.)
- Include Phase N-1 (Report and Typst Generation) and Phase N (PDF Compilation) ONLY when the task produces a deliverable report or document
- For edit/maintenance/configuration tasks, omit report generation phases entirely

**Example for a report-producing generic task (4 phases):**

### Phase 1: {Task-Specific Analysis} [NOT STARTED]
**Goal**: {Derived from research report findings}
**Tasks**:
- [ ] {Task derived from research context}
- [ ] {Additional task}
**Timing**: 45 minutes

### Phase 2: {Task-Specific Synthesis} [NOT STARTED]
**Goal**: {Derived from research report findings}
**Tasks**:
- [ ] {Task derived from research context}
**Timing**: 45 minutes

### Phase 3: Report and Typst Generation [NOT STARTED]
**Goal**: Generate Typst document as primary output and markdown report as fallback
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Generate self-contained typst document at founder/{slug}.typ
- [ ] Generate markdown report at strategy/{slug}.md (fallback)
- [ ] Validate all required sections present
**Timing**: 45 minutes

### Phase 4: PDF Compilation [NOT STARTED]
**Goal**: Compile Typst document to professional PDF
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Compile typst to PDF at founder/{slug}.pdf
- [ ] Verify output renders correctly
**Timing**: 15 minutes

**Example for an edit/maintenance task (2 phases, no report):**

### Phase 1: {Edit/Update Description} [NOT STARTED]
**Goal**: {Specific edit goal from research}
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Read target file(s)
- [ ] Apply required changes
- [ ] Verify changes applied correctly
**Timing**: 30 minutes

### Phase 2: Validation [NOT STARTED]
**Goal**: Verify all changes are correct and consistent
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Review modified files for correctness
- [ ] Check for unintended side effects
**Timing**: 15 minutes

**Effort estimates for generic type**: Scale with phase count: 1-2 phases = 1h, 3 phases = 2h, 4-5 phases = 3h.

### Stage 6: Write Plan File

```bash
padded_num=$(printf "%03d" "$task_number")
task_dir="specs/${padded_num}_${project_name}"
mkdir -p "$task_dir/plans"

# Generate short-slug from description
short_slug=$(echo "$description" | tr ' ' '-' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/[^a-z0-9-]//g' | cut -c1-30)

plan_file="$task_dir/plans/01_${short_slug}.md"
write "$plan_file" "$plan_content"

# Verify
[ -s "$plan_file" ] || return error "Failed to write plan file"
```

### Stage 6a: Verify Plan Format

**CRITICAL**: Before writing success metadata, re-read the plan file and verify it contains all required fields and sections per plan-format.md.

#### Required Metadata Fields (8)

Verify these fields exist in the plan header:

1. `- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]` - Must be present
2. `- **Task**: {N} - {title}` - Task identifier
3. `- **Effort**:` - Time estimate
4. `- **Dependencies**:` - Task dependencies
5. `- **Research Inputs**:` - Research report references
6. `- **Artifacts**:` - Plan file path
7. `- **Standards**:` - Referenced standards
8. `- **Type**:` - Language/report type

#### Required Sections (7)

Verify these section headings exist:

1. `## Overview`
2. `## Goals & Non-Goals`
3. `## Risks & Mitigations`
4. `## Implementation Phases`
5. `## Testing & Validation`
6. `## Artifacts & Outputs`
7. `## Rollback/Contingency`

#### Phase Format Verification

Under `## Implementation Phases`, verify:

- Each phase heading matches: `### Phase N: {name} [STATUS]`
- Each phase contains:
  - `**Goal**:` - Single statement
  - `**Tasks**:` - Bullet checklist
  - `**Timing**:` - Duration estimate

#### Verification Procedure

```bash
plan_file="$task_dir/plans/01_${short_slug}.md"

# Check required metadata fields
for field in "Status" "Task" "Effort" "Dependencies" "Research Inputs" "Artifacts" "Standards" "Type"; do
  grep -q "^\- \*\*${field}\*\*:" "$plan_file" || echo "ERROR: Missing ${field} field"
done

# Check required sections
for section in "## Overview" "## Goals & Non-Goals" "## Risks & Mitigations" "## Implementation Phases" "## Testing & Validation" "## Artifacts & Outputs" "## Rollback/Contingency"; do
  grep -q "^${section}" "$plan_file" || echo "ERROR: Missing section: ${section}"
done

# Check phase format
grep -q "^### Phase [0-9]" "$plan_file" || echo "ERROR: No phase headings found"
```

**If any required field or section is missing**:
1. Edit the plan file to add the missing field or section
2. Re-read the plan file to confirm the addition
3. Only proceed to write success metadata after all requirements are met

### Stage 7: Write Metadata File

Write final metadata to specified path:

```json
{
  "status": "planned",
  "summary": "Created {report_type} plan for {topic}. Integrated context from research report: {key_findings_summary}.",
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "type": "plan",
      "path": "specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/plans/01_{short-slug}.md",
      "summary": "{Report type} plan with research integration"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "session_id": "{from delegation context}",
    "duration_seconds": 120,
    "agent_type": "founder-plan-agent",
    "delegation_depth": 2,
    "delegation_path": ["orchestrator", "plan", "skill-founder-plan", "founder-plan-agent"],
    "report_type": "{market-sizing|competitive-analysis|gtm-strategy|contract-review|project-timeline|generic}",
    "mode": "{mode from research}",
    "phase_count": "{5 for specialized types, 1-5 for generic}",
    "research_report": "{path to research report}",
    "estimated_hours": "2-4 hours"
  },
  "next_steps": "Run /implement to execute the plan and generate report"
}
```

### Stage 8: Return Brief Text Summary

Return a brief summary (NOT JSON):

```
Founder plan created for task 234:
- Report type: market-sizing, mode: SIZE
- Read research report: specs/234_market_sizing_fintech_payments/reports/01_market-sizing.md
- Key context: Entity count 500K, price point $10K, geographic focus US/EU
- Plan: specs/234_market_sizing_fintech_payments/plans/01_market-sizing-plan.md
- 5 phases defined: TAM, SAM, SOM, Report and Typst Generation, PDF Compilation
- Metadata written for skill postflight
```

---

## Research Report Integration

The founder-plan-agent does NOT ask forcing questions. Instead, it:

1. **Reads** the research report created by the research phase
2. **Extracts** all gathered context from the report structure
3. **Integrates** this context into the plan phases
4. **References** the research report in the plan's "Research Integration" section

This ensures:
- Forcing questions are asked ONCE (during research)
- Plan is based on actual gathered data, not assumptions
- Context flows seamlessly from research -> plan -> implement

---

## Error Handling

### No Research Report Found

```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "summary": "Planning failed. No research report found for task.",
  "artifacts": [],
  "metadata": {...},
  "next_steps": "Run /research first to gather context via forcing questions"
}
```

### Research Report Incomplete

```json
{
  "status": "partial",
  "summary": "Created plan with incomplete context. Research report missing key sections.",
  "artifacts": [{...}],
  "partial_progress": {
    "missing_sections": ["Geographic Scope", "Capture Assumptions"]
  },
  "metadata": {...},
  "next_steps": "Review plan and supplement missing context, or re-run research"
}
```

---

## Critical Requirements

**MUST DO**:
1. Always read research report before creating plan
2. Always extract context from research report (not ask questions)
3. Always reference research report in plan's Research Integration section
4. Always store gathered context in plan file
5. Always determine report type from research report
6. Always generate 5-phase structure with Phase 4 generating Typst as primary output and Phase 5 as PDF Compilation (exception: generic type uses 1-5 phases, with report/PDF phases only when the task produces a deliverable document)
7. Always name Phase 5 "PDF Compilation" (project-timeline uses "PDF Compilation and Deliverables"; generic type may omit Phase 4/5 entirely for edit/maintenance tasks)
8. Always verify plan format at Stage 6a before writing metadata (all 8 metadata fields, all 7 sections, phase format)
9. Always write valid metadata file
