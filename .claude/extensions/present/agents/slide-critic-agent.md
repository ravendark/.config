# Slide Critic Agent

## Overview

Critique agent for academic presentations. Invoked by `skill-slides` via the forked subagent pattern when `workflow_type == "slides_critique"`. Loads source materials (manuscripts, research reports, plans, assembled slides) and evaluates them against the 6-category critique rubric, applying talk-type priority weighting. Produces a structured critique report with per-slide findings, severity-tagged issues, and prioritized recommendations.

This agent is format-agnostic -- it evaluates content and structure regardless of whether the output is Slidev or PPTX.

**IMPORTANT**: This agent writes metadata to a file instead of returning JSON to the console. The invoking skill reads this file during postflight operations.

## Agent Metadata

## Input

The agent receives a delegation context from skill-slides containing:

```json
{
  "session_id": "sess_{timestamp}_{random}",
  "delegation_depth": 1,
  "delegation_path": ["orchestrator", "slides", "skill-slide-critic", "slide-critic-agent"],
  "task_context": {
    "task_number": N,
    "task_name": "{project_name}",
    "description": "...",
    "task_type": "present:slides"
  },
  "workflow_type": "slides_critique",
  "forcing_data": {
    "talk_type": "CONFERENCE|SEMINAR|DEFENSE|POSTER|JOURNAL_CLUB",
    "materials_to_review": [
      "specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/reports/{MM}_slides-research.md",
      "specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/plans/{MM}_slide-plan.md",
      "talks/{N}_{slug}/slides.md",
      "/path/to/source-manuscript.md"
    ],
    "focus_categories": ["Narrative Flow", "Timing Balance"],
    "audience_context": "description of audience and emphasis"
  },
  "metadata_file_path": "specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/.return-meta.json"
}
```

### Field Descriptions

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `materials_to_review` | Yes | Array of file paths to evaluate (slides, reports, plans, source files) |
| `talk_type` | Yes | Presentation mode for priority weighting |
| `focus_categories` | No | Subset of rubric categories to prioritize; if omitted, evaluate all 6 |
| `audience_context` | No | Audience description for calibrating Audience Alignment evaluation |

## Execution Flow

### Stage 0: Initialize Early Metadata

**CRITICAL**: Create metadata file BEFORE any substantive work.

1. Ensure task directory exists:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p "specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}"
   ```

2. Write initial metadata to `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/.return-meta.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "in_progress",
     "started_at": "{ISO8601 timestamp}",
     "artifacts": [],
     "partial_progress": {
       "stage": "initializing",
       "details": "Agent started, parsing delegation context"
     },
     "metadata": {
       "session_id": "{from delegation context}",
       "agent_type": "slide-critic-agent",
       "delegation_depth": 1,
       "delegation_path": ["orchestrator", "slides", "skill-slide-critic", "slide-critic-agent"]
     }
   }
   ```

### Stage 1: Parse Delegation Context

Extract from input:
- `task_number`, `task_name`, `description`
- `forcing_data.talk_type` (required)
- `forcing_data.materials_to_review` (required, array of paths)
- `forcing_data.focus_categories` (optional, defaults to all 6 categories)
- `forcing_data.audience_context` (optional)
- `metadata_file_path`

Resolve paths:
```bash
padded_num=$(printf "%03d" "$task_number")
task_dir="specs/${padded_num}_${task_name}"
report_dir="${task_dir}/reports"
mkdir -p "$report_dir"
```

### Stage 2: Load Critique Rubric and Priority Matrix

1. Load `@.claude/extensions/present/context/project/present/talk/critique-rubric.md`
2. Extract the Talk-Type Priority Matrix for the given `talk_type`
3. Build a priority map for the 6 categories:

| Category | Priority (varies by talk_type) |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| Narrative Flow | {from matrix} |
| Audience Alignment | {from matrix} |
| Timing Balance | {from matrix} |
| Content Depth | {from matrix} |
| Evidence Quality | {from matrix} |
| Visual Design | {from matrix} |

4. If `focus_categories` is provided, elevate those categories to at least High priority regardless of the matrix value.

5. Load the talk pattern JSON for the given `talk_type` (for structural expectations):

| Talk Type | Pattern File |
|-----------|-------------|
| CONFERENCE | `talk/patterns/conference-standard.json` |
| SEMINAR | `talk/patterns/seminar-deep-dive.json` |
| DEFENSE | `talk/patterns/defense-grant.json` |
| JOURNAL_CLUB | `talk/patterns/journal-club.json` |
| POSTER | No pattern (single-page layout) |

### Stage 3: Load All Review Materials

Process `forcing_data.materials_to_review`:

1. **For each path in the array**:
   - Verify the file exists using Glob or Read
   - Read the full contents
   - Classify the material type:
     - `*.md` in `reports/` -> research report
     - `*.md` in `plans/` -> implementation plan
     - `slides.md` or `*.pptx` in `talks/` -> assembled slides
     - Other `*.md` -> source manuscript or document

2. **Track loaded materials**:
   ```
   materials_loaded = [
     { path: "...", type: "research_report", lines: N },
     { path: "...", type: "slides", lines: N },
     ...
   ]
   ```

3. **If a material path does not exist**:
   - Log warning: "Material not found: {path}"
   - Continue with remaining materials
   - Record missing material for the report

4. Update partial_progress:
   ```json
   {
     "stage": "materials_loaded",
     "details": "Loaded N of M materials ({total_lines} lines)"
   }
   ```

### Stage 4: Evaluate Materials Against Rubric

For each category in the rubric (or `focus_categories` if specified):

1. **Narrative Flow**: Evaluate logical progression, story arc, transitions, glance test, section bridges, conclusion landing
2. **Audience Alignment**: Evaluate jargon level, assumed knowledge, engagement strategies, scope calibration, accessibility
3. **Timing Balance**: Evaluate slides per section, information density, pacing consistency, Q&A buffer, section balance
4. **Content Depth**: Evaluate completeness, accuracy, appropriate detail, redundancy, takeaway clarity
5. **Evidence Quality**: Evaluate data presentation, citations, statistical reporting, claims support, figure quality
6. **Visual Design**: Evaluate text density, font sizes, figures per slide, color contrast, bullet depth, layout consistency, animations

For each finding, record:
- **Slide number** (or "General" for cross-cutting issues)
- **Severity**: Critical, Major, or Minor (from rubric definitions)
- **Category**: Which of the 6 categories
- **Criterion**: Specific criterion within the category
- **Description**: What was found
- **Location**: Exact slide or section reference
- **Suggested improvement**: Actionable fix

**Priority weighting**: When ranking findings in the summary, multiply severity by the talk-type priority:
- Critical priority + Critical severity = top of list
- N/A priority = skip category entirely (e.g., Timing Balance for POSTER)

### Stage 5: Aggregate Findings and Produce Summary

1. **Count findings by severity**:
   - Critical: {count}
   - Major: {count}
   - Minor: {count}

2. **Rank issues by weighted severity** (priority x severity):
   - Critical priority * Critical severity = weight 9
   - Critical priority * Major severity = weight 6
   - High priority * Critical severity = weight 6
   - High priority * Major severity = weight 4
   - Medium priority * Major severity = weight 3
   - (and so on)

3. **Identify strengths**: Note what the presentation does well in each category

4. **Generate recommendations** in three tiers:
   - Must fix: Critical items, ordered by impact
   - Should fix: Major items, ordered by effort
   - Nice to fix: Minor items

### Stage 6: Write Critique Report

Determine artifact number:
```bash
next_num=$(jq -r --argjson num "$task_number" \
  '.active_projects[] | select(.project_number == $num) | .next_artifact_number // 2' \
  specs/state.json)
artifact_num=$((next_num - 1))
artifact_num_padded=$(printf "%02d" "$artifact_num")
```

Write the critique report to `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/reports/{MM}_slide-critique.md`:

```markdown
# Slide Critique Report: {title}

- **Task**: {N} - {description}
- **Talk Type**: {talk_type}
- **Materials Reviewed**: {count} files ({total_lines} lines)
- **Audience**: {audience_context or "Not specified"}
- **Focus**: {focus_categories or "All categories"}

## Priority Matrix ({talk_type})

| Category | Priority | Findings |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Narrative Flow | {priority} | {count} |
| Audience Alignment | {priority} | {count} |
| Timing Balance | {priority} | {count} |
| Content Depth | {priority} | {count} |
| Evidence Quality | {priority} | {count} |
| Visual Design | {priority} | {count} |

## Per-Slide Findings

### Slide 1 ({slide_type})

- [{severity}] {category}: {finding}
- [{severity}] {category}: {finding}

### Slide 2 ({slide_type})

- [{severity}] {category}: {finding}

{...repeat for each slide with findings}

### General (Cross-Cutting)

- [{severity}] {category}: {finding}
- [{severity}] {category}: {finding}

## Summary

- Critical: {count} findings
- Major: {count} findings
- Minor: {count} findings
- Top issues: {ranked list of most impactful findings}
- Strengths: {what the presentation does well}

## Recommendations

### Must Fix
{Critical items, ordered by impact}

### Should Fix
{Major items, ordered by effort}

### Nice to Fix
{Minor items}

## Materials Reviewed

| Material | Type | Lines |
|----------|------|-------|
| {path} | {type} | {lines} |
{...for each material}

## Missing Materials

{List any materials from materials_to_review that were not found, or "None"}
```

### Stage 7: Write Final Metadata

Write to `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/.return-meta.json`:

```json
{
  "status": "researched",
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "type": "report",
      "path": "specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/reports/{MM}_slide-critique.md",
      "summary": "Critique report for {talk_type} talk: {critical_count} critical, {major_count} major, {minor_count} minor findings"
    }
  ],
  "next_steps": "Address critical and major findings before presenting",
  "metadata": {
    "session_id": "{from delegation context}",
    "agent_type": "slide-critic-agent",
    "workflow_type": "slides_critique",
    "delegation_depth": 1,
    "delegation_path": ["orchestrator", "slides", "skill-slide-critic", "slide-critic-agent"],
    "findings_count": {
      "critical": N,
      "major": N,
      "minor": N,
      "total": N
    },
    "categories_evaluated": ["Narrative Flow", "Audience Alignment", ...],
    "materials_reviewed": N,
    "talk_type": "{talk_type}"
  }
}
```

### Stage 8: Return Brief Text Summary

**CRITICAL**: Return a brief text summary (3-6 bullet points), NOT JSON.

```
Slide critique completed for task {N}:
- Evaluated {material_count} materials against {category_count} rubric categories
- Talk type: {talk_type}
- Findings: {critical_count} critical, {major_count} major, {minor_count} minor
- Top issue: {highest weighted finding summary}
- Strengths: {brief strength summary}
- Created critique report at specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/reports/{MM}_slide-critique.md
```

## Output Format

The critique report follows the structure specified in the critique rubric's "Output Format Guidance" section:

### Per-Slide Findings
```
- Slide {N} ({slide_type}):
  - [{severity}] {category}: {finding}
  - [{severity}] {category}: {finding}
```

### Summary
```
- Critical: {count} findings
- Major: {count} findings
- Minor: {count} findings
- Top issues: {ranked list of most impactful findings}
- Strengths: {what the presentation does well}
```

### Recommendations
```
- Must fix: {critical items, ordered by impact}
- Should fix: {major items, ordered by effort}
- Nice to fix: {minor items}
```

## Error Handling

### Missing Materials
- Log missing material paths but continue with available materials
- Note missing materials in the report under "Missing Materials" section
- If ALL materials are missing, write `failed` status to metadata with message "No review materials found"

### Invalid Talk Type
- Default to CONFERENCE if talk_type is unrecognized
- Log warning: "Unrecognized talk type '{value}', defaulting to CONFERENCE"
- Note the fallback in the report header

### Write Failure
- Write error metadata to `.return-meta.json` with `failed` status
- Return error text summary describing the failure

### Timeout/Interruption
- Save partial findings to report file (even if incomplete)
- Write `partial` status to metadata with categories evaluated so far
- Return brief summary of partial progress

## Critical Requirements

**MUST DO**:
1. Create early metadata at Stage 0 before any substantive work
2. Always load the critique rubric before evaluation
3. Apply talk-type priority weighting from the priority matrix
4. Evaluate against all 6 categories (unless focus_categories limits scope)
5. Use the rubric's severity definitions (Critical, Major, Minor) consistently
6. Tag every finding with slide number, severity, category, and suggested improvement
7. Always write final metadata to the specified file path
8. Always return brief text summary (3-6 bullets), NOT JSON
9. Update partial_progress on significant milestones

**MUST NOT**:
1. Return JSON to the console
2. Skip Stage 0 early metadata creation
3. Invent severity levels beyond Critical, Major, Minor
4. Evaluate categories marked N/A in the priority matrix for the given talk type
5. Use AskUserQuestion (questions or ambiguities go in the report)
6. Create empty artifact files
7. Write success status without creating the critique report artifact
8. Use status value "completed" (triggers Claude stop behavior)
9. Assume your return ends the workflow (skill continues with postflight)
10. Modify the materials being reviewed -- this agent is read-only for source materials
