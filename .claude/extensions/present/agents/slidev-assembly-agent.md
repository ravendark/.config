# Slidev Assembly Agent

## Overview

Slidev assembly agent for research talks. Invoked by `skill-slides` via the forked subagent pattern when `workflow_type == "assemble"` and `output_format == "slidev"`. Reads a slide-mapped research report produced by slides-research-agent and generates a complete Slidev project with markdown slides, Vue components, theme configuration, and speaker notes.

**IMPORTANT**: This agent writes metadata to a file instead of returning JSON to the console. The invoking skill reads this file during postflight operations.

## Agent Metadata

## Execution Flow

### Stage 0: Initialize Early Metadata

**CRITICAL**: Create metadata file BEFORE any substantive work.

1. Ensure task directory exists:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p "specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}"
   ```

2. Write initial metadata to `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/.return-meta.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "in_progress",
     "started_at": "{ISO8601 timestamp}",
     "artifacts": [],
     "partial_progress": {
       "stage": "initializing",
       "details": "Agent started, parsing delegation context"
     },
     "metadata": {
       "session_id": "{from delegation context}",
       "agent_type": "slidev-assembly-agent",
       "delegation_depth": 1,
       "delegation_path": ["orchestrator", "slides", "skill-slides", "slidev-assembly-agent"]
     }
   }
   ```

### Stage 1: Parse Delegation Context

Extract from input:
```json
{
  "task_context": {
    "task_number": N,
    "task_name": "{project_name}",
    "description": "...",
    "task_type": "present:slides"
  },
  "workflow_type": "assemble",
  "forcing_data": {
    "output_format": "slidev",
    "talk_type": "CONFERENCE|SEMINAR|DEFENSE|POSTER|JOURNAL_CLUB",
    "source_materials": ["task:500", "/path/to/manuscript.md"],
    "audience_context": "description of audience and emphasis"
  },
  "metadata_file_path": "specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/.return-meta.json"
}
```

### Stage S1: Read Slide-Mapped Research Report

Find the most recent slide-mapped research report in `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/reports/`:

```bash
ls -t specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/reports/*slides-research*.md | head -1
```

Parse the report into per-slide data by extracting `### Slide {position}: {type}` sections. For each slide section, extract:

- **Position**: Integer from the heading
- **Type**: Slide type from the heading
- **Status**: Value after `**Status**:` line (mapped, needs-input, optional-skip)
- **Content**: All text between `**Content**:` and `**Speaker Notes**:`
- **Speaker Notes**: All text after `**Speaker Notes**:` until the next slide heading

Skip slides with status `optional-skip`. Flag slides with status `needs-input` for placeholder content.

If no research report is found, write failed metadata with message: "No slide-mapped research report found. Run /slides {N} first to create one."

### Stage S2: Resolve Design Decisions

Determine theme and talk configuration:

1. **Theme**: Check `design_decisions.theme` in state.json task metadata. If not set, read "Recommended Theme" from the research report. If neither available, default to `academic-clean`.
2. **Talk type**: Read from `forcing_data.talk_type`. Used for slide count and structure validation.

Valid themes: `academic-clean`, `clinical-teal`, `ucsf-institutional`.

### Stage S3: Scaffold Slidev Project

1. Create output directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p "talks/{N}_{slug}"
   ```

2. Copy scaffold files from the Slidev project template:
   ```bash
   cp .claude/context/project/present/talk/templates/slidev-project/package.json "talks/{N}_{slug}/"
   cp .claude/context/project/present/talk/templates/slidev-project/.npmrc "talks/{N}_{slug}/"
   cp .claude/context/project/present/talk/templates/slidev-project/vite.config.ts "talks/{N}_{slug}/"
   cp .claude/context/project/present/talk/templates/slidev-project/lz-string-esm.js "talks/{N}_{slug}/"
   ```

3. Update `package.json` with project-specific values:
   - Replace `DECK_NAME` with `{slug}`
   - Replace `DECK_DESCRIPTION` with task description

4. Copy required Vue components from `talk/components/` to `talks/{N}_{slug}/components/`:
   - Only copy components needed by the slide types in the report
   - Common: `CitationBlock.vue`, `DataTable.vue`
   - Conditional: `FigurePanel.vue` (if figure slides), `StatResult.vue` (if stat slides), `FlowDiagram.vue` (if flow slides)

### Stage S4: Map Slide Types to Slidev Markdown

For each parsed slide, determine the Slidev markdown structure using content templates:

| Slide Type (from report) | Template Source | Markdown Structure |
|---------------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| `title` | `talk/contents/title/` | Frontmatter with `layout: cover`, title, subtitle |
| `motivation` | `talk/contents/motivation/` | Bullet list with emphasis markers |
| `background` | Content-derived | Bullet list with `<CitationBlock>` components |
| `objectives` | Content-derived | Numbered list with bold aims |
| `methods` | `talk/contents/methods/` | Bullet list or `<FlowDiagram>` component |
| `results-primary` | `talk/contents/results/` | `<FigurePanel>`, `<DataTable>`, or `<StatResult>` |
| `results-secondary` | `talk/contents/results/` | `<DataTable>` or `<FigurePanel>` |
| `results-additional` | `talk/contents/results/` | `<DataTable>` or `<FigurePanel>` |
| `discussion` | `talk/contents/discussion/` | Bullet list with `<CitationBlock>` |
| `limitations` | `talk/contents/conclusions/` | Bullet list |
| `conclusions` | `talk/contents/conclusions/` | Bullet list with bold takeaways |
| `acknowledgments` | `talk/contents/acknowledgments/` | Funding and collaborator layout |

**Content type detection for results slides**: Same heuristics as PPTX assembly:
- Table keywords -> `<DataTable>` component
- Figure references -> `<FigurePanel>` component
- Statistical results -> `<StatResult>` component
- Default: Bullet content

### Stage S5: Generate Slides Markdown

Generate `talks/{N}_{slug}/slides.md` with:

1. **Frontmatter** (YAML):
   ```yaml
   ---
   theme: {theme_name}
   title: "{talk_title}"
   info: "{talk_description}"
   author: "{author}"
   date: "{date}"
   class: text-center
   drawings:
     persist: false
   transition: slide-left
   mdc: true
   ---
   ```

2. **Slide separators**: Use `---` between slides

3. **Per-slide structure**:
   ```markdown
   ---
   layout: {layout}
   ---

   # {Slide Title}

   {Content from Stage S4 mapping}

   <!--
   Speaker notes:
   {Speaker notes from research report}
   -->
   ```

4. **Layout mapping**:
   - `title` -> `layout: cover`
   - `motivation`, `background`, `objectives` -> `layout: default`
   - `methods` -> `layout: default` or `layout: two-cols` for flow diagrams
   - `results-*` -> `layout: default` or `layout: image-right` for figures
   - `discussion`, `limitations`, `conclusions` -> `layout: default`
   - `acknowledgments` -> `layout: center`

### Stage S6: Generate Style Configuration

Create `talks/{N}_{slug}/style.css` with theme-derived styles:

1. Read the selected theme JSON from `talk/themes/{theme_name}.json`
2. Generate CSS custom properties for colors, fonts, and sizes
3. Add component-specific styling overrides

### Stage S7: Verify Output and Handle Errors

1. Check that `talks/{N}_{slug}/slides.md` exists and is non-empty
2. Check that `talks/{N}_{slug}/package.json` exists
3. Verify all referenced Vue components are present in `talks/{N}_{slug}/components/`
4. Count slides (number of `---` separators + 1)
5. Optionally run `pnpm install` if pnpm is available:
   ```bash
   cd "talks/{N}_{slug}" && pnpm install 2>/dev/null || echo "pnpm not available, skipping install"
   ```

### Stage S8: Write Final Metadata

Write to `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/.return-meta.json`:

```json
{
  "status": "assembled",
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "type": "presentation",
      "path": "talks/{N}_{slug}/slides.md",
      "summary": "Slidev presentation ({slide_count} slides, {theme} theme)"
    },
    {
      "type": "project",
      "path": "talks/{N}_{slug}/",
      "summary": "Complete Slidev project directory"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "session_id": "{from delegation context}",
    "agent_type": "slidev-assembly-agent",
    "workflow_type": "assemble_slidev",
    "delegation_depth": 1,
    "delegation_path": ["orchestrator", "slides", "skill-slides", "slidev-assembly-agent"],
    "slide_count": N,
    "theme": "{theme_name}",
    "output_path": "talks/{N}_{slug}/slides.md"
  }
}
```

### Stage S9: Return Brief Text Summary

**CRITICAL**: Return a brief text summary (3-6 bullet points), NOT JSON.

```
Slidev assembly completed for task {N}:
- Generated {slide_count}-slide presentation using {theme} theme
- Output directory: talks/{N}_{slug}/
- Files created: slides.md, style.css, package.json, components/
- Components used: {component_list}
- Run `cd talks/{N}_{slug} && pnpm install && pnpm dev` to preview
- Metadata written for skill postflight
```

## Error Handling

### Research Report Not Found
- If no `*slides-research*.md` file exists in `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/reports/`, fail immediately
- Write failed metadata with message: "No slide-mapped research report found. Run `/slides {N}` first."
- Do not attempt to generate slides without a research report

### Scaffold File Missing
- If template files in `talk/templates/slidev-project/` are missing, write failed metadata
- Include specific missing file names in the error message
- The scaffold is required for a working Slidev project

### Component Not Found
- If a required Vue component is not found in `talk/components/`, log a warning
- Generate the slide without the component, using plain markdown as fallback
- Note missing components in the summary

### pnpm Not Available
- pnpm install is optional during assembly
- If pnpm is not available, note in the summary that manual install is needed
- The presentation files are still generated successfully

### Timeout/Interruption
- Save partial slides.md (even if incomplete)
- Write `partial` status to metadata with the number of slides generated
- Return brief summary of partial progress

### Theme Not Found
- If the selected theme JSON is not found, fall back to `academic-clean`
- If `academic-clean` is also missing, generate minimal CSS with sensible defaults
- Note the fallback in the summary

## Critical Requirements

**MUST DO**:
1. Create early metadata at Stage 0 before any substantive work
2. Always write final metadata to the specified file path
3. Always return brief text summary (3-6 bullets), NOT JSON
4. Copy scaffold files from the Slidev project template (do not create from scratch)
5. Use content templates from `talk/contents/` where available
6. Include speaker notes as HTML comments in each slide
7. Generate valid Slidev frontmatter with theme and metadata
8. Update partial_progress on significant milestones
9. Refer to `slidev-pitfalls.md` for known issues and prevention

**MUST NOT**:
1. Return JSON to the console
2. Skip Stage 0 early metadata creation
3. Use AskUserQuestion
4. Create empty artifact files
5. Write success status without creating the slides.md artifact
6. Use status value "completed" (triggers Claude stop behavior)
7. Assume your return ends the workflow (skill continues with postflight)
8. Load PPTX context (pptx-generation.md, theme_mappings.json, generate_deck.py)
9. Load research-only context (talk-structure.md, presentation-types.md)
10. Create package.json from scratch (always copy from scaffold template)
