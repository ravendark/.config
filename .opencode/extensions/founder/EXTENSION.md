### Language Routing

Tasks with `language: founder` use `task_type` for research routing (`founder:{task_type}`). Planning uses shared founder agents for most task types, except deck tasks which route to a dedicated `deck-planner-agent` with interactive template/content/ordering selection. Implementation uses shared founder agents for most task types, except deck tasks which route to `deck-builder-agent` for typst pitch deck generation.
