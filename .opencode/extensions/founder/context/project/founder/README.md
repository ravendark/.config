# Founder Context

Strategic business analysis context for founders and entrepreneurs.

## Overview

This context directory provides domain knowledge, decision frameworks, templates, and a deck library for strategic business analysis. Inspired by Y Combinator office hours methodology and CEO cognitive patterns from gstack. Version 3.0 adds legal analysis, financial modeling, project planning, pitch deck construction, and Typst PDF output.

## Key Concepts

### Forcing Questions

One question per interaction, push for specificity. Vague answers are not accepted.

**The Six Forcing Questions**:
1. **Demand Reality**: What evidence proves someone wants this?
2. **Status Quo**: What do users do today to solve this?
3. **Desperate Specificity**: Name one specific person who needs this
4. **Narrowest Wedge**: What's the smallest version someone would pay for?
5. **Observation**: What surprised you watching someone use this?
6. **Future-Fit**: Does your product become more essential over time?

### Decision Frameworks

- **Two-Way Doors**: Reversible decisions -- move fast, 70% information
- **One-Way Doors**: Irreversible decisions -- be rigorous, 90% information
- **Inversion**: Ask both "How do we win?" and "What makes us fail?"
- **Focus as Subtraction**: Document what NOT to do

### Operational Modes

Commands offer 3-4 modes giving users explicit scope control:
- Selection happens early in interaction
- All subsequent analysis adapts to mode
- Mode switches are explicit and confirmed

## Related Commands

| Command | Context Used | Purpose |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| `/market` | `domain/business-frameworks`, `patterns/forcing-questions`, `templates/market-sizing` | Market sizing analysis |
| `/analyze` | `domain/business-frameworks`, `patterns/forcing-questions`, `templates/competitive-analysis` | Competitive analysis |
| `/strategy` | `domain/strategic-thinking`, `patterns/decision-making`, `templates/gtm-strategy` | GTM strategy development |
| `/sheet` | `domain/spreadsheet-frameworks`, `patterns/cost-forcing-questions` | Cost breakdown spreadsheet |
| `/legal` | `domain/legal-frameworks`, `patterns/contract-review`, `patterns/legal-planning`, `templates/contract-analysis` | Contract review and legal analysis |
| `/project` | `domain/timeline-frameworks`, `patterns/project-planning` | Project scoping and timeline planning |
| `/finance` | `domain/financial-analysis`, `patterns/financial-forcing-questions`, `templates/financial-analysis` | Financial modeling and projections |
| `/deck` | `deck/` library, `patterns/pitch-deck-structure`, `patterns/slidev-deck-template` | Pitch deck construction with Slidev |

## Context Discovery

Context files are loaded automatically by agents via `index-entries.json`, which maps each file to the agents, languages, and commands that need it. The extension loader merges these entries into the main `.opencode/context/index.json` at load time.

Query example -- find all context for the `/legal` command:

```
entries where load_when.commands contains "/legal"
```

This returns `domain/legal-frameworks.md`, `patterns/contract-review.md`, `patterns/legal-planning.md`, and `templates/contract-analysis.md`.

Manual loading via @-references is also supported:

```markdown
@.opencode/extensions/founder/context/project/founder/domain/business-frameworks.md
@.opencode/extensions/founder/context/project/founder/templates/market-sizing.md
```

## Deck Library

The `deck/` subdirectory contains a complete Slidev deck library with 49 indexed items across 6 categories: themes, patterns, animations, styles, components, and content templates. Agents use `deck/index.json` to select and compose items into pitch decks.

See [deck/README.md](deck/README.md) for full documentation including the content slot system, agent navigation patterns, and library extension guide.
