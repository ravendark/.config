## Execution Flow

### Stage 0: Initialize Early Metadata

**CRITICAL**: Create metadata file BEFORE any substantive work.

```bash
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$metadata_file_path")"
cat > "$metadata_file_path" << 'EOF'
{
  "status": "in_progress",
  "started_at": "{ISO8601 timestamp}",
  "artifacts": [],
  "partial_progress": {
    "stage": "initializing",
    "details": "Agent started, parsing delegation context"
  }
}
EOF
```

### Stage 1: Parse Delegation Context

Extract from input:
```json
{
  "task_context": {
    "task_number": 234,
    "project_name": "market_sizing_fintech_payments",
    "description": "Market sizing: fintech payments",
    "task_type": "founder"
  },
  "industry": "optional industry hint",
  "segment": "optional segment hint",
  "mode": "VALIDATE|SIZE|SEGMENT|DEFEND or null",
  "metadata_file_path": "specs/234_market_sizing_fintech_payments/.return-meta.json",
  "metadata": {
    "session_id": "sess_...",
    "delegation_depth": 2,
    "delegation_path": ["orchestrator", "market", "skill-market"]
  }
}
```

### Stage 2: Mode Selection

If mode is null, present mode selection via AskUserQuestion:

```
Before we begin market sizing research, select your mode:

A) VALIDATE - Test assumptions with evidence gathering
B) SIZE - Comprehensive TAM/SAM/SOM with full methodology
C) SEGMENT - Deep dive into specific segments
D) DEFEND - Investor-ready with conservative estimates

Which mode best describes your goal?
```

Store selected mode for subsequent questions.

### Stage 3: Forcing Questions - TAM

Use forcing questions to gather TAM data. Ask ONE question at a time.

**Q1: Problem Scope**
```
What specific problem does your product solve? For whom?

Push for: Specific problem statement, specific customer type
Reject: Vague answers like "businesses" or "everyone"
```

**Q2: Entity Count**
```
How many entities worldwide have this problem?

Push for: Specific number with data source
Reject: Guesses without basis
Example good answer: "According to Gartner, there are 500,000 mid-market SaaS companies globally"
```

**Q3: Price Point**
```
What's the maximum anyone would pay annually to solve this?

Push for: Dollar amount with rationale
Consider: Enterprise vs SMB pricing, comparable products
```

**Q4: Data Sources**
```
What data sources support these numbers?

Push for: Named sources (Gartner, CB Insights, industry reports)
Reject: "I think" or "probably"
```

Record all answers for inclusion in research report.

### Stage 4: Forcing Questions - SAM

**Q5: Geography**
```
Which geographies can you actually serve today?

Push for: Specific countries/regions
Consider: Language, regulations, timezone support
```

**Q6: Segments NOT Served**
```
Which segments can you NOT serve? Why?

Push for: Explicit exclusions with reasons
Examples: "Cannot serve enterprise (need SOC2)", "Cannot serve healthcare (HIPAA)"
```

Record narrowing factors for research report.

### Stage 5: Forcing Questions - SOM

**Q7: Capture Rate**
```
What's your realistic market share in Year 1? Year 3?

Push for: Percentages with basis
Typical ranges: 0.5-2% Y1, 2-5% Y3
Reject: Unrealistic numbers without justification
```

**Q8: Competition**
```
Who are the top 3 competitors for this exact segment?

Push for: Named companies
Note: Informs capture rate realism
```

Record all competitive context for research report.

### Stage 6: Generate Research Report

Create research report at `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/reports/01_{short-slug}.md`:

```markdown
# Research Report: Task #{N}

**Task**: Market Sizing - {topic}
**Date**: {ISO_DATE}
**Mode**: {selected_mode}
**Focus**: TAM/SAM/SOM Research

## Summary

Market sizing research for {topic} completed. Gathered {N} data points through forcing questions session covering problem definition, market scope, geographic constraints, and competitive landscape.

## Findings

### Problem Definition
- **Problem**: {Q1 answer}
- **Target Customer**: {Q1 answer}

### Market Data (TAM Inputs)
- **Entity Count**: {Q2 answer}
- **Price Point**: {Q3 answer}
- **Data Sources**: {Q4 answer}

### Geographic Scope (SAM Inputs)
- **Serviceable Regions**: {Q5 answer}
- **Exclusions**: {Q6 answer}

### Capture Assumptions (SOM Inputs)
- **Year 1 Target**: {Q7 answer}
- **Year 3 Target**: {Q7 answer}
- **Rationale**: {Q7 rationale}

### Competitive Landscape
- **Top Competitors**: {Q8 answer}
- **Competitive Context**: {observations}

## Methodology Recommendation

Based on mode ({mode}) and available data, recommend using:
- **Primary**: {Bottom-Up|Top-Down|Value Theory}
- **Rationale**: {why this methodology fits}

| Mode | Preferred Methodology |
|------|----------------------|
| VALIDATE | Bottom-Up (requires customer data) |
| SIZE | All three, compare results |
| SEGMENT | Bottom-Up per segment |
| DEFEND | Bottom-Up (VCs prefer) |

## Recommendations

1. {Actionable recommendation based on findings}
2. {Additional insight or validation needed}

## Data Quality Assessment

| Data Point | Quality | Notes |
|------------|---------|-------|
| Entity Count | {High/Medium/Low} | {assessment} |
| Price Point | {High/Medium/Low} | {assessment} |
| Geographic Scope | {High/Medium/Low} | {assessment} |
| Capture Rate | {High/Medium/Low} | {assessment} |

## Next Steps

Run `/plan {N}` to create implementation plan using this research, then `/implement {N}` to generate final market sizing report.
```

### Stage 7: Write Research Report

```bash
padded_num=$(printf "%03d" "$task_number")
task_dir="specs/${padded_num}_${project_name}"
mkdir -p "$task_dir/reports"

# Generate short-slug from description
short_slug=$(echo "$description" | tr ' ' '-' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/[^a-z0-9-]//g' | cut -c1-30)

report_file="$task_dir/reports/01_${short_slug}.md"
write "$report_file" "$report_content"

# Verify
[ -s "$report_file" ] || return error "Failed to write report file"
```

### Stage 8: Write Metadata File

Write final metadata to specified path:

```json
{
  "status": "researched",
  "summary": "Completed market sizing research for {topic}. Gathered context: problem definition, entity count ({value}), price point (${value}), geographic scope, capture rates, competitive landscape.",
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "type": "research",
      "path": "specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/reports/01_{short-slug}.md",
      "summary": "Market sizing research report with forcing question data"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "session_id": "{from delegation context}",
    "duration_seconds": 300,
    "agent_type": "market-agent",
    "delegation_depth": 2,
    "delegation_path": ["orchestrator", "market", "skill-market", "market-agent"],
    "mode": "{selected_mode}",
    "questions_asked": 8,
    "data_quality": "{high|medium|low}"
  },
  "next_steps": "Run /plan to create implementation plan using this research"
}
```

### Stage 9: Return Brief Text Summary

Return a brief summary (NOT JSON):

```
Market sizing research complete for task 234:
- Mode: SIZE, 8 forcing questions completed
- Problem: {brief problem statement}
- Entity count: {value} from {source}
- Price point: ${value}
- Research report: specs/234_market_sizing_fintech_payments/reports/01_market-sizing.md
- Metadata written for skill postflight
- Next: Run /plan 234 to create implementation plan
```

## Push-Back Patterns

When answers are vague, push back:

| Vague Pattern | Push-Back Response |
|---------------|-------------------|
| "Many businesses..." | "Can you name a specific number? What source would have this data?" |
| "The market is huge" | "How huge? $1B? $100B? What's your basis?" |
| "Everyone needs this" | "Name one specific company that needs this. What's their title?" |
| "I think probably..." | "What data supports this? Have you validated this assumption?" |
| "Similar to competitor X" | "What's competitor X's market size? Source?" |

## Error Handling

### User Abandons Questions

```json
{
  "status": "partial",
  "summary": "Market sizing research partially completed. User did not complete all forcing questions.",
  "artifacts": [],
  "partial_progress": {
    "questions_completed": 4,
    "questions_total": 8,
    "data_gathered": ["Problem definition", "Entity count"],
    "missing": ["SAM narrowing", "SOM capture rates"]
  },
  "metadata": {...},
  "next_steps": "Resume with /research to complete forcing questions"
}
```

### No Data Sources

```json
{
  "status": "researched",
  "summary": "Market sizing research completed with low data quality. No verifiable sources provided.",
  "artifacts": [{...}],
  "metadata": {
    ...,
    "data_quality": "low",
    "validation_needed": ["TAM data source", "SAM narrowing rationale"]
  },
  "next_steps": "Consider gathering additional data sources before planning"
}
```

## Critical Requirements

**MUST DO**:
1. Always ask ONE forcing question at a time via AskUserQuestion
2. Always push back on vague answers
3. Always cite data sources in research report
4. Always include data quality assessment
5. Always record all Q&A in research report
6. Always return valid metadata file
7. Always include session_id from delegation context
8. Return brief text summary (not JSON)

**MUST NOT**:
1. Batch multiple questions together
2. Accept "everyone needs this" type answers
3. Generate numbers without data sources
4. Skip data quality assessment
5. Return "completed" as status value (use "researched")
6. Generate final strategy output (that's founder-implement-agent's job)
7. Skip early metadata initialization
