# Founder Extension (v3.0)

Strategic business analysis tools for founders and entrepreneurs. Integrates forcing question patterns and decision frameworks inspired by Y Combinator office hours methodology and gstack.

## What's New in v3.0

- **Unified Phased Workflow**: All 9 commands (market, analyze, strategy, legal, project, deck, finance, sheet, consult) follow the same `/research -> /plan -> /implement` lifecycle
- **Project Command Updated**: `/project` now creates research reports instead of generating timelines directly
- **Per-Type Routing**: Complete routing table with 5 types across 3 phases (research, plan, implement)
- **Breaking Changes**: project-agent is now research-only; TRACK/REPORT modes move to `/implement`

## Overview

This extension provides nine commands for strategic business analysis:

| Command | Purpose | Output |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `/market` | TAM/SAM/SOM market sizing | Market sizing report |
| `/analyze` | Competitive landscape analysis | Competitive analysis with positioning map |
| `/strategy` | Go-to-market strategy | GTM strategy with 90-day plan |
| `/legal` | Contract review and legal counsel | Risk assessment, negotiation strategy |
| `/project` | Project timeline management | WBS, PERT estimates, Gantt timeline |
| `/deck` | Pitch deck creation | Slidev pitch deck with material synthesis |
| `/finance` | Financial analysis | Revenue verification, runway analysis |
| `/sheet` | Cost breakdown spreadsheets | Budget and cost analysis spreadsheets |
| `/meeting` | Investor meeting note processing | Structured meeting file with YAML frontmatter, CSV tracker update |
| `/consult` | Collaborative design consultation | Socratic dialogue with domain expert perspective |

## Installation

This extension is automatically available when loaded via the extension picker.

## MCP Tool Setup

The founder extension integrates MCP tools for enhanced data gathering.

### SEC EDGAR (No Setup Required)

SEC EDGAR provides access to public company filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K). No API key or configuration needed.

- **Fully free**, unlimited access to SEC public filings
- **Used by**: market-agent (for public company financials and market sizing)
- **Lazy loaded**: Only starts when market-agent is invoked

### Firecrawl (Free Tier - 500 credits/month)

Firecrawl enables full-page web scraping for competitor analysis.

**Setup**:
1. Visit https://firecrawl.dev/
2. Create a free account
3. Copy API key from dashboard
4. Add to shell profile:
   ```bash
   export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY="your-key-here"
   ```
5. Restart terminal or source your profile

**Capabilities**:
- `scrape`: Full page content as markdown
- `crawl`: Recursive site crawling
- `map`: Site structure mapping
- `extract`: LLM-powered data extraction

**Used by**: analyze-agent (for competitor website analysis)

**Note**: Firecrawl is optional. If API key is not configured, analyze-agent will fall back to WebSearch for competitor research.

## Workflow

### Standard Phased Workflow (All Commands)

All commands follow the same lifecycle:

```
/{command} "description"
    |
    v
[1] Ask forcing questions, create task with forcing_data
    |  Status: [NOT STARTED]
    v
/research {N}
    |
    v
[2] Domain-specific research agent gathers data
    |  Status: [RESEARCHED]
    v
/plan {N}
    |
    v
[3] Shared planner creates implementation plan
    |  Status: [PLANNED]
    v
/implement {N}
    |
    v
[4] Shared implementer generates final artifact
    |  Status: [COMPLETED]
    v
Report in strategy/{type}-{slug}.md
Summary in specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/summaries/
```

### Per-Type Research Agents

| Command | Research Agent | Specialization |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| /market | market-agent | SEC EDGAR, TAM/SAM/SOM, bottom-up sizing |
| /analyze | analyze-agent | Firecrawl, competitor websites, positioning |
| /strategy | strategy-agent | Channel analysis, positioning, GTM |
| /legal | legal-council-agent | Contract review, risk assessment, escalation |
| /project | project-agent | WBS, PERT estimation, resource allocation |
| /deck | deck-research-agent | Material synthesis, slide mapping |
| /finance | finance-agent | Financial verification, runway analysis |
| /sheet | spreadsheet-agent | Cost breakdown, budget generation |
| /consult | legal-analysis-agent | Collaborative design consultation (--legal) |

### Legacy Workflow (--quick)

```
/{command} --quick [args]
    |
    v
skill-{type} -> {type}-agent
    |
    v
founder/{report-type}-{datetime}.md
```

## Key Patterns

### Forcing Questions

Every command uses forcing questions to extract specific, evidence-based information. Questions are asked one at a time, and vague answers are pushed back on.

**Anti-patterns detected and rejected**:
- "Everyone needs this" -> Push for specific customer
- "Many businesses" -> Push for named companies
- "The market is huge" -> Push for specific numbers with sources

### Mode-Based Operation

Each command offers 3-4 operational modes that give users explicit scope control. Mode selection happens early and affects all subsequent analysis.

### Completeness Principle

"When AI reduces marginal cost of completeness to near-zero, optimize for full implementation rather than shortcuts."

All commands evaluate multiple scenarios, not just the optimistic one.

### Decision Frameworks

- **Two-way doors**: Reversible decisions - move fast, 70% information
- **One-way doors**: Irreversible decisions - be rigorous, 90% information
- **Inversion**: Also ask "What makes us fail?"
- **Focus as subtraction**: Explicitly document what NOT to do

## Output Artifacts

### Task Mode

| Command | Report | Tracking |
|---------|--------|----------|
| /market | `strategy/market-sizing-{slug}.md` | `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/` |
| /analyze | `strategy/competitive-analysis-{slug}.md` | `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/` |
| /strategy | `strategy/gtm-strategy-{slug}.md` | `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/` |
| /legal | `strategy/contract-analysis-{slug}.md` | `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/` |
| /project | `strategy/timelines/{slug}.typ` | `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/` |

### Legacy Mode (--quick)

| Command | Artifact |
|---------|----------|
| /market --quick | `founder/market-sizing-{datetime}.md` |
| /analyze --quick | `founder/competitive-analysis-{datetime}.md` |
| /strategy --quick | `founder/gtm-strategy-{datetime}.md` |
| /legal --quick | `founder/contract-analysis-{datetime}.md` |
| /project --quick | `founder/project-timeline-{datetime}.typ` |
