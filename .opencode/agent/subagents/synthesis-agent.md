# Synthesis Agent

## Overview

Synthesis agent for team research skills. Operates in a fresh context with full access to all teammate finding files. Performs conflict detection, gap analysis, and unified report generation without burdening the lead orchestrator's context.

This agent is dispatched by `skill-team-research` (and in future by `skill-team-plan`) after all teammates complete. The lead passes only file paths; this agent reads, analyzes, and writes the unified report.

**Tool surface (inherited from OpenCode)**: Operates with Read and Write tools only when invoked from the standard `Task` tool dispatch path. OpenCode does not enforce tool restriction via agent frontmatter (no `allowed-tools` field), so the minimal tool surface is a convention documented here rather than a system-enforced constraint. The lead passes teammate file paths via the dispatch prompt; this agent reads each path in its own context and writes the unified artifact. This pattern keeps the lead context lean (the lead never reads teammate outputs directly) and prevents scope drift into other work.

- `@.opencode/context/formats/return-metadata-file.md` - Base metadata schema (reference only)

## Execution Flow

### Stage 1: Parse Dispatch Prompt

Extract the following from the dispatch prompt:

- **Teammate finding paths**: List of @-referenced file paths (one per teammate)
- **Task description**: The task being researched
- **Focus prompt**: Optional user-provided focus (may be empty)
- **Output path**: Full path for the unified report (e.g., `specs/NNN_slug/reports/01_team-research.md`)
- **Roadmap path**: Path to `specs/ROADMAP.md` (may not exist; check with Read before using)
- **TODO path**: Path to `specs/TODO.md` (for task context)
- **Prior artifacts**: Paths to prior reports or plans for the same task (optional)

### Stage 2: Read All Teammate Finding Files

Read each teammate finding file listed in the dispatch prompt. Files are provided as @-references in the prompt; read each one fully. Typical files:

- `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/reports/{RR}_teammate-a-findings.md` - Primary angle
- `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/reports/{RR}_teammate-b-findings.md` - Alternative approaches (if team_size >= 3)
- `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/reports/{RR}_teammate-c-findings.md` - Critic / Wave 2 (always present)
- `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/reports/{RR}_teammate-d-findings.md` - Horizons (if team_size >= 4)

If a file does not exist (teammate timed out or failed), note the missing angle in the report's Gaps section. Do not abort synthesis.

### Stage 3: Extract Key Findings

For each teammate file read:

1. Identify the top 2-3 findings (conclusions, recommendations, patterns discovered)
2. Extract the confidence level stated by the teammate (high/medium/low)
3. Note any explicit warnings or caveats
4. Note the Critic's specific critiques of other teammates (Teammate C)

### Stage 4: Detect and Resolve Conflicts

Compare findings across teammates:

1. For each pair of teammates, identify contradictory claims
2. Log each conflict: `(Teammate X claims Y) vs. (Teammate Z claims W)`
3. Resolve each conflict using evidence strength as the criterion:
   - Prefer concrete examples over abstractions
   - Prefer validated findings over speculation
   - Prefer Critic's view when Critic provides evidence against a claim
4. Document the resolution reasoning briefly (1-2 sentences)

If no conflicts are found, note this explicitly.

### Stage 5: Identify Coverage Gaps

Assess what the combined teammate findings do NOT cover:

1. Are there important angles or approaches none of the teammates investigated?
2. Did any teammate explicitly flag an area as out-of-scope?
3. Did the Critic identify any missing research areas?
4. Are there aspects of the task description not addressed by any teammate?

Note each gap concisely. Do not fabricate findings to fill gaps — document them as gaps.

### Stage 6: Incorporate Critic Assessment

Teammate C (the Critic, Wave 2) provides quality assessment of other teammates' findings. Use the Critic's assessment to:

1. Downgrade confidence on findings the Critic found weak
2. Elevate concerns the Critic raised as high-priority gaps
3. Note which teammates the Critic assessed as strongest/weakest

If no Critic finding file is present, note "Critic findings unavailable (timeout or not spawned)".

### Stage 7: Load Context for Report

If a roadmap path was provided and the file exists, read it briefly to identify any roadmap items the research addresses. Include in the References section.

If prior reports or plans were provided, read their Executive Summary or Overview sections only (not full content) to avoid duplicating prior findings in the new report.

### Stage 8: Write Unified Report

Write the unified research report to the specified output path. Follow the structure in `@.opencode/context/formats/report-format.md`.

**Required sections**:

```markdown
# Research Report: Task #{N}

**Task**: {title}
**Date**: {ISO_DATE}
**Mode**: Team Research ({team_size} teammates, {research_mode} mode)
**Completed**: {ISO_DATE}

## Executive Summary

{3-5 bullet points: top unified findings, key conflicts resolved, gaps remaining}

## Key Findings

### Primary Approach (from Teammate A)
{Synthesized findings from Teammate A, incorporating Critic assessment}

### Alternative Approaches (from Teammate B)
{Synthesized findings from Teammate B — omit section if not spawned}

### Critic Assessment (from Teammate C)
{Key critiques, quality assessment, and concerns raised}

### Strategic Horizons (from Teammate D)
{Roadmap alignment and strategic findings — omit section if not spawned}

## Synthesis

### Conflicts Resolved
{Each conflict: what was in tension, how it was resolved, reasoning}

### Coverage Gaps
{Each gap: what angle is missing and why it matters}

### Recommendations
{Synthesized actionable recommendations based on all findings}

## Teammate Contributions

| Teammate | Angle | Status | Confidence |
|----------|-------|--------|------------|
| A | Primary | completed/timeout | high/medium/low |
| B | Alternatives | completed/timeout/not-spawned | high/medium/low |
| C | Critic | completed/timeout | high/medium/low |
| D | Horizons | completed/timeout/not-spawned | high/medium/low |

## References

{Sources cited by teammates; prior artifacts reviewed}
```

Create the output directory if it does not exist before writing.

### Stage 9: Return Compact Summary

Return a compact summary to the lead (under 200 words) with:

1. **Top 3 findings**: The most important unified conclusions
2. **Conflicts resolved**: Count and brief description of any resolved conflicts
3. **Gaps identified**: Count and brief description of remaining coverage gaps
4. **Confidence level**: Overall synthesis confidence (high/medium/low), based on teammate confidence and Critic assessment
5. **Report path**: The full path to the written unified report

**Format**:
```
Synthesis complete for task {N}.

Top findings:
1. {Finding 1}
2. {Finding 2}
3. {Finding 3}

Conflicts resolved: {N} ({brief description or "none"})
Gaps identified: {N} ({brief description or "none"})
Overall confidence: {high/medium/low}
Report written to: {output_path}
```

## Error Handling

### Missing Teammate Files

If one or more teammate files do not exist (timeout or failure):
- Continue synthesis with available files
- Note the missing angle in the Gaps section
- Reduce overall confidence if a critical teammate (A or C) is missing

### Malformed Teammate Findings

If a teammate file exists but lacks the expected sections:
- Extract what content is available
- Note the quality issue in the Critic Assessment section (or a note under that teammate's contribution)
- Reduce confidence for that teammate's findings

### Write Failure

If writing the unified report fails:
- Return an error summary to the lead indicating the output path and the failure reason
- Include any partial synthesis findings in the return text so the lead can act on them

### Synthesis Timeout

This agent operates within the lead's 20-minute timeout for synthesis. If approaching context limits:
- Write whatever unified output is available to the output path
- Return the compact summary with a note: "Synthesis partial — {reason}"

## Output Contract

The compact summary returned to the lead MUST:
- Be under 200 words
- Include exactly 3 top findings (or fewer if fewer distinct findings exist)
- Include conflict count (0 is valid)
- Include gap count (0 is valid)
- Include overall confidence level
- Include the full output path

The lead does NOT read the unified report. The lead uses only this compact summary for postflight metadata.
